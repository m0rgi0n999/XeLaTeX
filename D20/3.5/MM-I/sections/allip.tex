\noindent{\textit{The creature that floats before you is like a thing out of nightmare. It has a vaguely humanoid shape, but it's a shape without features that has been distorted and bristles with madness. From the waist down, it trails away into vaporous nothingness, leaving a faint trace of fog behind it as it moves.}}

\noindent{An allip is the spectral remains of someone driven to suicide by a madness that afflicted it in life. It craves only revenge and unrelentingly pursues those who tormented it in life and pushed it over the brink.}\\
\indent{An allip cannot speak intelligibly.}

\dndsection{COMBAT}
\noindent{An allip is unable to cause physical harm, although it doesn?t appear to know that. It keeps flailing away at enemies, yet it inflicts no wounds.}\\
\indent{\textbf{Babble (Su):} An allip constantly mutters and whines to itself, creating a hypnotic effect. All sane creatures within 60 feet of the allip must succeed on a DC 16 Will save or be affected as though by a hypnotism spell for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting compulsion effect. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same allip?s babble for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.}\\
\indent{\textbf{Madness (Su):} Anyone targeting an allip with a thought detection, mind control, or telepathic ability makes direct contact with its tortured mind and takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage.}\\
\indent{\textbf{Wisdom Drain (Su):} An allip causes 1d4 points of Wisdom drain each time it hits with its incorporeal touch attack. On each such successful attack, it gains 5 temporary hit points.}

  \noindent{Archons are celestials from a lawful good-aligned plane.}\\
  \noindent{Archons speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, but can speak with almost any creature because of their tongues ability.}

  \dndsection{COMBAT}
  \noindent{Archons generally prefer to meet a foe head-on if it is prudent to do so, but if outmatched, they do what they can to even the odds (usually by employing hit-and run tactics or standing off and engaging a foe with magic before moving into melee).}\\
  \indent{\textbf{Archon Traits:} An archon possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).}\\
  \indent{--Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.}\\
  \indent{--\textit{Aura of Menace (Su):} A righteous aura surrounds archons that fight or get angry. Any hostile creature within a 20-foot radius of an archon must succeed on a Will save to resist its effects. The save DC varies with the type of archon, is Charisma-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus. Those who fail take a –2 penalty on attacks, AC, and saves for 24 hours or until they successfully hit the archon that generated the aura. A creature that has resisted or broken the effect cannot be affected again by the same archon’s aura for 24 hours.}\\
  \indent{--Immunity to electricity and petrification.}\\
  \indent{-- +4 racial bonus on saves against poison.}\\
  \indent{--\textit{Magic Circle against Evil (Su):} A magic circle against evil effect always surrounds an archon (caster level equals the archon’s Hit Dice). (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in an archon’s statistics block.)}\\
  \indent{--\textit{Teleport (Su):} Archons can use greater teleport at will, as the spell (caster level 14th), except that the creature can transport only itself and up to 50 pounds of objects.}\\
  \indent{--\textit{Tongues (Su):} All archons can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a tongues spell (caster level 14th). This ability is always active.}

  \noindent{\textit{A ball of glowing light floats toward you.}}

  \noindent{Lantern archons appear as floating balls of light that glow about as brightly as a torch. Only their destruction can extinguish the glow, though they can try to hide it.}\\
  \indent{Lantern archons are very friendly and usually eager to give what assistance they can. However, their bodies are just gaseous globes, and they are much too weak to render any material aid. Lantern archons speak in soft, musical voices.}\\
  \dndsubsection{Combat}
  \noindent{A lantern archon has little reason to get within melee range. It usually hovers just close enough to bring the enemy within its aura of menace, then blasts away with its light rays. Lantern archons prefer to concentrate on a single opponent, seeking to reduce enemy numbers quickly.}\\
  \indent{\textbf{Aura of Menace (Su):} Will DC 12 negates.}\\
  \indent{\textbf{Light Ray (Ex):} A lantern archon’s light rays have a range of 30 feet. This attack overcomes damage reduction of any type.}\\

  \dndsubsection{HOUND ARCHON HERO MOUNTS}
  \noindent{In the course of their adventures, many hound archon heroes befriend bronze dragons, which may come to serve as their mounts. The relationship between these mounts and their celestial riders goes beyond even the special bond between paladin and mount. The dragon and the archon are naturally allies and friends, as can be expected of two powerful servants of cosmic justice. The juvenile bronze dragon mount gains 2 additional HD, 4 points of Strength, an additional 4 points of natural armor, improved evasion, and +10 feet to speed in all its movement forms. The dragon cannot, however, command other creatures of its type as other kinds of paladin mounts can.} \\

\noindent{This is the \textsc{Dungeons \& Dragons}� Roleplaying Game, the game that defines the genre and has set the standard for fantasy roleplaying for more than 30 years.}\\
\indent{Specifically, this is the \textit{Monster Manual}. This book contains entries for hundreds of creatures, both hostile and benign, for use in \textsc{Dungeons \& Dragons} adventures. This book, the \textit{Player's Handbook}, and the \textit{Dungeon Master's Guide} comprise the core rules for the D\&D� game.}\\
\indent{This introduction explains how to read each creature's write-up. It often refers to the Glossary, located in Chapter 7 at the back of this book (starting on page 305), for more details on attack forms and the special qualities associated with monsters.}\\
\indent{A list of monsters organised by Challenge Rating appears on pages 318 and 319 to make it easy for the Dungeon Master to tailor encounters to the party level of the player characters.}\\

%% You will need to create a separate file called statreset.tex,
%% which contains a catalog of every stat command that would ever be
%% used in your stat block. This file would look something like the
%% following lines:
\def\DDname {}
\def\DDclslvl {}
\def\DDalign {}
\def\DDsize {}
\def\DDtype {}
\def\DDsubtype{}
\def\DDinit {}
\def\DDsenses {}
\def\DDaura {}
\def\DDlang {}
\def\DDAC {}
\def\DDtouch {}
\def\DDflat {}
\def\DDhp {}
\def\DDhd {}
\def\DDregen {}
\def\DDDR {}
\def\DDimm {}
\def\DDres {}
\def\DDSR {}
\def\DDfort {}
